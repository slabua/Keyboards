### A hand-wired custom Mechanical Keyboard based on the [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/).


Finally I had the time to wrap up my little side project started about three months ago, and I thought to share it here. Although inspired by the Atreus, I couldn't quite find the right compromise among the non-split ergo keyboards, so I decided to make my own.

## Components:
- 1x RP2040 (KMK on Raspberry Pi Pico), USB-C port
- 50x switches
- 1x SSD1306 128x64px 0.96in IIC OLED display
- 2x EC11 rotary encoders
- 1x EVQWGD001 rotary encoder
- 1x Pimoroni IIC trackball breakout
- 1x Active buzzer
- 2x micro switches (bootsel, reset)
- 3D printed case (5-10Â° tilt), plate, pcb

## Story
The design started from a semi-automated customised process by forking an OpenSCAD hotswap pcb generator repository, subsequently heavily worked on Blender. I had also added cutouts for per-key rgb, but in the end I gave up the idea of hand wiring the LEDs. At least in this version which, for me, has been an insightful experience.
I am slowly finalising the firmware configuration and I will eventually put it on github as usual. Wiring diagram and key layout will come along later.
